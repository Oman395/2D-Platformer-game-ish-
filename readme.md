# Melvin
Melvin is a little passion project I am working on, with help from my sibling for story & art. Not going for greatness per se, but just a decent game.

Appears to need more then 120hz monitor for whatever reason, Maybe less or more but 120 is all it's tested on b/c my laptop's hdmi only supports 1080p120. Currently working on a fix, appears to be b/c it doesent know when not to apply gravity.
